Fully populated Jira board boilerplates per project type created from a CSV file using Jira REST API.

The script parses the CSV columns for components, epics, versions and tickets.

Each boilerplate contains about 100 tickets as baseline for the projects, additional scope will need to be added by the TL and the PM and TL will need to ensure all the tickets have appropriate descriptions and are fit for the project at hand.

The CSV source files can be regularly maintained by adding tickets as knowledge evolves and learnings from post-mortems as tickets for production or TL - e.g apple submission guidelines.
