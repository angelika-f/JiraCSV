2 = Supporting new hardware, dropped support for previous hardware.
3 = Old user accounts are no longer supported, new accounts need to be made.

Minor
The minor number reflects improvements/minor changes made to the application.
0 = no changes
1 = Improved graphics of characters
2 = Add new minigame

Patch
The patch number reflects small fixes or adjustments to existing functionality. These are commonly bug fixes or adjustments to difficulty.
0 = no path
1 = Fixes for broken animations
2 = Adjusted difficulty levels of world 5

Example codes:

 - You must fill out a “Data Encryption form” for the French government in order to make your app available in France if you encrypt data in your app.

Ensure digital certificates are prepared for signing assets,Task,2 - High,Angelika Filuba,61afe51febce470067dbd482,Beta,App Submission,"Shared
- At the very start of the project, consider the following:
  - Who is submitting the App?
     -UNIT9? The Client?
  - Whose account is it being submitted to?
     - Likely the Client.

- Start this conversation early, as we will need to plan accordingly.
 - Can they give us Dev Access to their accounts?
 - Or can they provide us with the signing materials?
   - IMPORTANT: Signing materials can expire. So keep note of this expiration date and plan accordingly so that you don’t end up being blocked on submission day.

- Do a test submission as soon as possible to check that the app can be uploaded correctly and that the provided signing assets are valid.
 - It’s possible that the files aren’t correct or are out of date.
 - Test them by submitting to:
   - Apple Testflight
   - Google Alpha/Beta Testing

Apple App Store
- The signing assets will take the form of:
  - NAME.mobileprovision.
     - One for submission (App Store)
     - One for Testflight (Ad Hoc)
  - NAME.p12

- Both p12 and mobileprovision files are required if we cannot get dev access.
- Additional files may be needed depending on the services you use, for example Apple Push Notifications (APNs).

Google Play Store
- The signing assets will take the form of:
 - NAME.keystore
 - IMPORTANT: The SHA1 key used in the keystore will likely be overwritten by the SHA1 value in the Play Store during submission.
   - This means that external services like Google APIs will fail when you test a downloaded app from Google Alpha/Beta/Store pages.

*This template contains the following:*

# All basic tickets to create a website/microsite.
## Including linked sub tasks.
# Additional tickets for localisation, WebAR, backend, sharing and video capture.
## These may be deleted if they are not in scope of your project.
# Components list and all issues linked to respective component.
# Epics list and all issues linked to respective epics.
# Release versions list and all issues linked to respective versions.



The following is to be communicated to the team by the *Project Manager*:

*Guidance for the Tech Lead:*

# ALL TICKETS must be vetted by the TL, properties include:
## Descriptions
## Time estimates
## Priorities
## Assignees
## Fix versions
## Epic & Component links
# The TL will need to add additional scope of the project (tickets) that is not included in this template.
# The TL may delete tickets/epics/components that are not applicable to the project.



*Guidance for the Team:*

# All in-progress and done tickets *MUST* have time tracking logged. The team should be reminded to update this every time they mark tickets as in-progress and done.
# The team should only work on tickets in the sprint. If the team is working on tickets outside of the sprint, this can mean that they have run out of actionable tasks/are blocked on all tasks in the sprint. This needs to be clearly communicated in the Jira board.



*Guidance for the Project Manager:*

# ALL COMPONENTS must be assigned to the Tech Lead at the start of the project. 
## The PM must consult with the TL if there are any components that need to be assigned to any developer other than the TL
## The QA component should be assigned to the QA Lead once they are assigned to the project.
# ALL TICKETS must be checked by the Project Manager that they contain appropriate descriptions and links for the following:
## Links to Figma board/frames. Attached images if applicable.
## Links to Google Drive/Asset Folders.
## Links to relevant decks, asset trackers, documentation.
# Backlog maintenance:
## Before every sprint plan, the backlog should be ordered by *priority*.
## Tickets should be allocated to sprints during sprint plans when the sprint goals are communicated clearly to the team.",3600,3600,Production,Angelika Filuba,61afe51febce470067dbd482,Production
